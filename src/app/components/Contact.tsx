                        I have been learning Blender for work and in my spare time. I started by watching the now world renouned 'Donut' video. After completing that challenge I tried an Anvil then picked my own object to model which was an axe which I had in the tool shed. Going from taking reference photos to the modelling proccess to rendering was alot of fun.
