This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app

## Learning The Ropes

Dont have much experience with React so wanted to try make a small website to showcase the projects I've done over the past few years in a language I didn't have alot of experience with.

The installation I used was:
- next.js
- typescript
- tailwindcss

I had only a small introduction to typescript before so it was a good learning experience to try next.js although I didn't use many of it's features. Tailwind was very easy to pick up once I decided to actually use it.

The styling of the website is a slight modification of the default next.js template theme.
